# 2015doubly
This repository contains the MATLAB code from the following publication:

S. Kaltwang, S. Todorovic, and M. Pantic, 
“Doubly Sparse Relevance Vector Machine for Continuous Facial Behavior Estimation,” 
IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2015.

Please cite the publication above, in case that you use this software.

Usage:
- include the ./code folder and all sub-folders in the MATLAB path
- execute example_dsrvm.m for a demo on random data
- see the comments within example_dsrvm.m to adapt the model to your needs

This code has been tested with MATLAB R2013a.

Parts of this code is a modified version of the [SparseBayes toolbox](http://www.miketipping.com/) by Mike Tipping.

For convenience, this repository also contains a copy of the [TPROD toolbox](http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/16275-tprod-arbitary-tensor-products-between-n-d-arrays) by Jason Farquhar.
